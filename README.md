# Custom GeminiCli — based on Gemini, python

A lightweight console client for Google Gemini API, optimized for local codebase analysis. 
It allows you to instantly feed your entire project context into the model for debugging, refactoring, or architectural review.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install uv
This project requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage Python and dependencies.

```powershell
uv sync
```

### 3. Create API-token
go to https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys and create api-token
cmd:
```cmd
set "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here"
```
powershell:
```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Run
```powershell
uv run gcli
```

### ⌨️ In-Chat Commands
```powershell
